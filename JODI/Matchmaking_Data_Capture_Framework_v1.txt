1. Design Philosophy
This framework defines every data point the matchmaking service should capture, how each is obtained, and when in the user journey it becomes available. The design is informed by Keeper.ai (100+ questions, 800+ factors), Three Day Rule (15 years of matchmaker-trained data), and the Indian/Chinese/Jewish matchmaking traditions where family, community, and cultural alignment carry weight.

Core principle: Data points fall into two categories — Explicit (user directly states it) and Inferred (the AI extracts it from conversation, voice, or behavior patterns). The inferred layer is what separates an AI matchmaker from a form. Every casual message is a data capture opportunity.

The filter vs. signal distinction: Some data points are hard filters — they eliminate people outright (age out of range, wrong city, incompatible religion). These must be indexed columns in Postgres. Everything else is a compatibility signal — it increases or decreases match quality but doesn’t eliminate. Signals live in JSONB and feed the scoring engine.

The Keeper lesson: Don’t activate a profile for matching until you have minimum viable data. Users who skip through intake and get poor matches blame the service, not themselves. Better to hold them in a ‘building your profile’ state until you have enough to match confidently.

2. The Four Tiers
Each tier has a user-facing name, a minimum data threshold, and a clear value proposition communicated to the user. The service does not begin matching until Tier 2 (“Ready”) is complete. Tier names are designed to feel progressive and motivating, not clinical.

Tier
User-Facing Name
Time to Complete
Data Points
Matching Status
User Sees
Tier 1
“The Basics”
5–7 min (first session)
15–20 fields
NOT active
“Building your profile…”
Tier 2
“Ready”
2–4 sessions over 3–7 days
35–50 fields
ACTIVE — matching begins
“You’re in. Searching…”
Tier 3
“Deep Profile”
Ongoing, weeks 2–4
60–80 fields
Active + higher priority
“Sharpening matches…”
Tier 4
“Calibrated”
Post-match feedback loops
80–120+ fields
Active + best matches
“Dialed in.”

The progression is communicated to users as a percentage or progress bar: “Your profile is 40% complete — the more I know, the better your matches.” This creates a pull mechanic without blocking access.

●  TIER 1: THE BASICS   Hard filters + identity  ·  5–7 minutes  ·  Required before anything
These are the non-negotiable fields. They define who you are and who you categorically will or won’t match with. Every field here becomes an indexed Postgres column. The bot collects these conversationally in the first session. No profile is created in the matching pool until Tier 1 is complete.

●  TIER 2: READY   Lifestyle + values + preferences  ·  3–7 days  ·  Matching activates here
This tier transforms the profile from a filter set into a matchable person. The bot collects this through conversational drip questions (1–3 per session) and passive extraction from freeform chat. Matching begins once Tier 2 reaches 70%+ completion.

●  TIER 3: DEEP PROFILE   Personality depth + psychological signals  ·  Weeks 2–4  ·  Higher match priority
This is where the AI matchmaker starts to outperform human matchmakers. These signals emerge from sustained conversation, pattern recognition, and explicit deep-dive questions. Users at this tier get priority in matching and access to richer compatibility explanations.

●  TIER 4: CALIBRATED   Post-match learning  ·  Ongoing  ·  Best possible matches
This is the tier that no form or questionnaire can reach. Calibration data comes exclusively from how users react to actual matches — what excites them, what disappoints them, what surprises them. The delta between stated preferences and revealed preferences is the most valuable matching signal in existence.

3. The Inferred Signal Layer
This is the AI matchmaker’s competitive advantage over every form-based service. Every message, voice note, and behavioral pattern generates signals that the user never explicitly provides. These signals are extracted by the LLM in real-time and stored with confidence scores (0.0–1.0) that improve with repeated observation.

Background + family convo
Needs trust (Tier 2+)

4. Activation Rules
Drawing from Keeper’s approach of not rushing users into matching, the following rules govern when a profile becomes active:

Minimum Viable Profile (MVP) for Matching
	•	100% of Tier 1 fields populated (all hard filters + at least 1 photo)
	•	At least 70% of Tier 2 fields populated (minimum: occupation, 3+ values signals, love language, 2+ lifestyle fields)
	•	At least 2 open-ended responses that generated meaningful personality signals
	•	Profile completeness score ≥ 45% (weighted across all tiers)
	•	User has interacted across at least 2 separate sessions (prevents rushed single-session signups)
Priority Scoring
Once active, users are prioritized for matching based on profile completeness. A Tier 3 user with 80% completeness will receive match attempts before a Tier 2 user at 50%, because the data quality enables better matches (which protects brand reputation through first-match experience). This creates a natural incentive: share more, get matched sooner and better.
The Hold State
Users who complete Tier 1 but haven’t reached the MVP threshold see a message like: “I’m learning a lot about you. I need a little more to start finding great matches — chat with me for a few more minutes and we’ll get there.” This is the Keeper pattern: present, encouraging, not gating with a hard wall. If a user goes dormant before reaching MVP, the bot sends a gentle re-engagement after 48 hours: “Hey, I was thinking about what you told me about [specific thing they shared]. Quick question…”

Of the 100+ data points, approximately 40% are explicitly collected and 60% are inferred by the AI. This ratio is the key differentiator versus Keeper (which collects most data explicitly through long questionnaires) and Three Day Rule (which relies heavily on human matchmaker intuition). The AI inference layer lets us capture equivalent or superior depth with significantly less user effort.
